    Using types in selectors reduces the flexibility and narrows the applicability of CSS styles. Classes should be
    preferred as they improve the understandability by giving elements a context-specific name.
    For example:
</p>
<pre>
.myBox span {
  color: black;
}
</pre>
<p>
    This styling can only be applied to a limited subset of all containers with the .someThing class.
    Furthermore the reader cannot identify what the span actually represents.
    An alternative using a class instead of a type does not have this issue:
</p>
<pre>
.myBox .headline {
  color: black;
}
</pre>
<p>The intent is clear and the contextual understandability improved dramatically.</p>


<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
span {
  display: block;
}

.mybox div {
  color: red;
}
</pre>

<p>
    You can exclude certain types via the configuration of this rule as e.g. the anchor type is a valid exception from this rule as it should always denote a link of some sort.
